**Mobile6TiSCH**

The 6TiSCH architecture, defined by the IETF, is aimed at enabling the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).  
Many industrial applications involve mobile devices (e.g., mobile robots or wearable devices carried by workers), however 6TiSCH does not provide any mechanism to manage
node mobility.

Here we present Mobile6TiSCH, a simulation tool based on OMNeT++, that implements a flexible and adaptive architecture to handle nodes' mobility in 6TiSCH networks. 
The proposed tool is modular, as showm in Figure, and allows to evaluate the Quality of Service (QoS) for each mobile node, in different scenarios considering different mobility patterns, scheduling algorithms, network configuration
parameters and Border Router deployment strategies. 

Mobile6TiSCH can be used to evaluate different solutions in a simulated environment before implementing them in practice.
